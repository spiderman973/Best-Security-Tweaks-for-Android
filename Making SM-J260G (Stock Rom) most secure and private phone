hey huys, I will show you how to make SM-J260G (Samsung Galaxy J2 Core Stock Rom) the most secure and private phone
Warning! I will not talk about installing any custom rom Biomterics and NFC, Device Encryption (not File Encryption) are not avalible in SM-J260G
The first step is to have authentication on your phone I don't recommend Lock Patterns because they are very easy to guess,
due to human nature most people don't use complicated patterns, So they become very easy to crack.
If you use sd cards you can encrypt sd Cards in SM-J260G Do Not use Weak Passwords to encrypt your Sd carda they are very easy to crack.
Uninstalling Facebook, Whatsapp you because even if whatsapp uses end-to-end encryption Whatsapp still collects MetaData,
No you will say hey i don't care about whatsapp knowing my contacts,battery status,call history but my dear friend If Whatsapp knows that you called to Bob
but Whatsapp Doesn't Know What you Said Whatsapp also knows at which location you called at which time you called they can pretty much know what you said
